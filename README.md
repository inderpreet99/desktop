# ShabadOS-Core

Contains the standalone frontend and backend applications for ShabadOS, with an Electron wrapper.

## Development

The `app` folder contains the Electron wrapper, the backend Node application, and the frontend React application.

Requirements:
* [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
* On macOS, you will need Xcode Tools via `xcode-select --install` and the latest npm via `npm install --global npm`.

To install dependencies, run `npm install`, which will also install the dependencies for the frontend and backend.

To spin up the development servers, run `npm run dev`, which will launch a frontend server on `https://localhost:3000`, and a backend server on `https://localhost:42425`.

If you'd prefer to use docker-compose, `docker-compose up` will install the dependencies and spin up the backend and frontend.

### Frontend

Using `create-react-app`. Websockets for synchronising clients. API for search.

### Backend

Using proposed ES+ modules with the `esm` shim module.
Any changes to the backend when running using `docker-compose`,
or `npm run dev` will result in the server restarting.

In development, the backend app runs on port `42425` by default.

### Packaging with Electron

Windows? You must install [windows-build-tools](!https://www.npmjs.com/package/windows-build-tools), by running `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` in an administrator Powershell.

Run `npm run pack` to generate the binaries to test for your platform, and `npm run dist` to build an installer.

Electron-builder is used internally.

The backend will then run on port 42424.

### Contributing Guidelines

We're happy to accept suggestions and pull requests!

This repository follows the **Airbnb's Javascript Style Guide**, with a few minor modifications. Notably, spaces should be included inside parentheses and brackets (weird, right!). An ESLint file is provided,
and your code will automatically be checked on-commit for style.
It is recommended to install an ESLint plugin for your editor (VS Code's `ESLint` plugin works out of the box), so you can receive linter suggestions as you type.

Create one feature per branch, preferably working against an issue. PRs will be squashed and merged when complete.

When writing commit messages, please follow the **[seven rules](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/#seven-rules)**.
